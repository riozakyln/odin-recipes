    <h2>Sweet blueberries and tart lemon pair well in this blueberry lemon breakfast quinoa, an alternative to oatmeal. High in protein and fiber, quinoa is a great start to your day! I made this up one morning when I had a craving for quinoa and was looking for a change from the usual.</h2>
    <p> Top with extra milk for a thinner consistency. It's also good with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
        <li>2 cups nonfat milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>Â½ lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1 cup blueberries</li>

        <li>
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            <p>Rinse quinoa with cold water in a fine-mesh strainer to remove bitterness until water runs clear and is no longer frothy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            <p>Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir quinoa and salt into milk; simmer over medium-low heat until most liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir maple syrup and lemon zest into quinoa mixture. Gently fold in blueberries.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            <p>Divide quinoa mixture between 2 bowls; top each with 1 teaspoon flax seed to serve.</p>
